# Piano Score Editor — Project Plan

Personal-use music notation software focused on piano scores: create, edit,
engrave, print, and (optionally) play back.

Status: M1 DONE 2026-09-13. M2 next. All section-10 decisions confirmed by Frank.

---

## 1. Guiding constraints

- Single user, macOS, pianist. Optimize for fast entry and good-looking piano
  output, not for orchestral breadth or collaboration.
- Grand staff is the default and first-class object. Cross-staff notes,
  pedal marks, fingering, voices per staff, and hand-splitting are core, not
  afterthoughts.
- Output quality target: "looks like a real published edition" (Henle-ish),
  because you will be reading these at the piano.
- Everything must be testable without a human eye where possible: golden SVG
  renders, model round-trips, MusicXML corpus round-trips.

## 2. Technology stack **[confirm]**

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (strict) | One language for model, layout, UI, and playback; huge ecosystem for SVG/MIDI/audio. |
| Rendering | Hand-rolled SVG engraver using a SMuFL font (Bravura or Leland) | Piano notation (cross-staff beams, voices, pedal, ottava) fights VexFlow's abstractions. SMuFL gives glyph metrics + engraving defaults from `*_metadata.json`. |
| App shell | Vite web app first; wrap in Tauri later for a native .app | Browser gives print-to-PDF, Web MIDI, Web Audio for free. Tauri adds native file dialogs and a dock icon when wanted. |
| UI framework | Solid or React (lean toward Solid for fine-grained updates on a big score) | The score canvas is custom SVG anyway; the framework only drives panels/palettes. |
| State/undo | Immutable score model + command pattern | Undo/redo is non-negotiable in a notation editor. |
| Tests | Vitest + snapshot SVG tests + a small MusicXML corpus | Layout regressions are visual; snapshots catch them. |
| Print/PDF | Paginated SVG → `window.print()` initially; `svg2pdf.js`/`pdf-lib` later for direct export | Browser print with `@page` CSS is good enough to start. |

Alternative considered: VexFlow for rendering. Faster to first pixel, but we would
hit its walls on piano-specific layout within weeks. Rejected unless you want
a quick prototype first.

Alternative considered: LilyPond as the engraver (write a LilyPond file, shell
out, show the PDF). Best-looking output on day one, but no interactive editing,
slow feedback loop. Could be an *export* target later.

## 2a. Reference software (what to borrow)

| Software | Borrow | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| **Noteflight** (browser, you've used it) | Browser-native SVG score, keyboard step entry with auto-advancing cursor, MIDI step input, simple palettes. Closest existing model to this plan. | Cloud dependency, limited engraving control, weak cross-staff/pedal handling. |
| **Cakewalk Score Writer** (older, you've used it) | Staff-and-cursor mental model; piano-first defaults. | Its MIDI-first model where notation is a view of a MIDI track; we keep notation as the source of truth and derive playback. |
| **MuseScore 4** | Keyboard shortcuts (number = duration, letter = pitch), voice handling, palettes, Leland font, MusicXML behavior as the de-facto reference. | UI sprawl. |
| **Dorico** | Best-in-class semantic model: content vs. layout separation, "flows", auto engraving with minimal manual nudging, popovers for text entry of dynamics/tempo. Our model/layout split and the command bar idea come from here. | Complexity of its multi-layout system. |
| **Sibelius / Finale** | Keypad-driven entry (Sibelius), mature engraving rules. | Legacy formats. |
| **LilyPond** | Engraving quality benchmark; its spacing and slur algorithms are documented and worth reading. Possible export target. | Text-only workflow for interactive use. |
| **Verovio / MEI** | Clean rendering-engine architecture (data → layout → SVG), SMuFL usage. Good code to study for engraving/. | MEI as native format is overkill here. |

Rule of thumb: Noteflight for the *feel*, Dorico for the *model*, LilyPond and
Verovio for the *engraving math*, MuseScore for *shortcuts and MusicXML compatibility*.

## 3. File format

### 3.1 Native format: versioned JSON (`.pscore`)
- Human-readable, diffable, trivially loaded in TS. Schema versioned with a
  `formatVersion` and migration functions.
- Durations are exact rationals (numerator/denominator of a whole note), never
  floats. Tuplets carry an explicit ratio. Ticks are a playback-only concept.
- Every element has a stable `id` so spanners (slurs, hairpins, pedal lines,
  ottava) reference endpoints by id and survive edits.

### 3.2 Document model (sketch)
```
Score
  meta: title, composer, copyright, page/engraving settings
  parts[]              # piano = one Part with staves = 2
    staves[]           # clef per staff, staff lines, default
    measures[]         # measure-level: time sig, key sig, barline, repeats, rehearsal
      voices[]         # up to 4 per staff; each voice is a sequence
        events[]       # Note | Chord | Rest | (grace group, tuplet group)
          Note: pitch{step, alter, octave}, duration, tie, accidental
                (explicit / courtesy / auto), staffOverride (cross-staff),
                fingering, articulations[], notehead, stemDir override
  spanners[]           # slur, hairpin, pedal, ottava, trill line, tie-across-system
  attachments[]        # dynamics, tempo, text, fermata → anchored to event/measure ids
  layout hints         # forced system/page breaks, manual nudges (kept separate
                       # from musical content so "reset layout" is trivial)
```
Principle: musical content and presentation overrides live in separate trees.

### 3.3 Interchange
- **MusicXML** import/export (partwise). This unlocks MuseScore, Dorico,
  Finale, IMSLP-derived files. Aim for a correct subset (notes, voices,
  articulations, dynamics, slurs, ties, tuplets, pedal, fingering, repeats).
- **MIDI** export (and import with quantization, later).
- PDF/SVG export for printing.

## 4. Display / engraving pipeline

Model → **Semantic pass** → **Horizontal spacing** → **Line breaking** →
**Vertical layout** → **SVG render**.

1. Semantic pass (per measure, per staff)
   - Stem direction rules (single voice: by average pitch; two voices: up/down).
   - Beaming groups from time signature (and manual overrides).
   - Accidental logic: what to show given key signature and earlier notes in
     the measure; courtesy accidentals; ties across barlines.
   - Chord notehead stacking (seconds offset to the right), accidental
     stacking columns.
   - Rest positioning in multi-voice contexts.
   - Cross-staff notes: note belongs to a voice on staff A but is drawn on
     staff B; beams may span staves.

2. Horizontal spacing
   - Duration-based ideal widths (width ∝ log of duration, standard
     engraving practice) with minimum distances from glyph bounding boxes.
   - Align simultaneous onsets across both staves (and voices) into columns.
   - Prefix items (clef, key, time, accidentals) get fixed widths.

3. Line breaking
   - Start greedy (fill system to max width, then justify). Upgrade to
     Knuth–Plass style optimal breaking if greedy looks uneven.
   - Honor forced breaks from layout hints.

4. Vertical layout
   - Staff-to-staff distance for the grand staff; system spacing on page.
   - Place dynamics, pedal, text, and slurs in "lanes" with collision
     avoidance against note skylines (compute a simple skyline per staff).
   - Slurs as cubic Béziers with endpoints/heights chosen from the skyline.

5. Render
   - Pure function: `LayoutResult → SVG string/DOM`. Glyphs from a SMuFL font
     via `<text>` with the font family, metrics from the SMuFL metadata JSON.
   - Interactive mode: each element carries `data-id` for hit-testing.
   - Print mode: paginated pages at real physical size (mm), `@page` CSS.

Engraving defaults (staff line thickness, stem width, beam thickness, etc.)
come straight from the SMuFL font metadata and are user-tweakable in settings.

## 5. User input

Selection model first: a cursor (position in time × staff × voice) plus a
selection (single element, list, or a rectangular range of measures×staves).
Every edit is a Command with `apply`/`invert` for undo.

Entry modes (all can be mixed):

1. **Step entry via computer keyboard** (Dorico/MuseScore-style, primary):
   - Number keys pick duration (e.g. 5 = quarter, 6 = half, 4 = eighth).
   - Letters A–G enter pitch; nearest-octave rule; `Shift+Up/Down` octave;
     `+`/`-` sharp/flat; `.` dot; `0` rest; `T` tie; `Shift+letter` adds to
     chord; `Tab`/arrows move cursor; `V` switches voice; `X` flips staff for
     cross-staff.
   - Cursor advances automatically after each entry.
2. **MIDI keyboard step entry**: pitch(es) from the MIDI device, duration from
   the current keyboard-selected value. Holding several keys at once = chord.
   Cheap to add on top of mode 1 via Web MIDI.
3. **Mouse/trackpad**: click to select, drag to move pitch, drag handles on
   slurs/hairpins, palettes for articulations/dynamics/ornaments, context
   menus for properties.
4. **Text mini-language** in a command bar (optional, later): e.g. type
   `c4 e g c5` or `mf` or `ped` at the cursor. Fast for a pianist who thinks
   in notes.
5. **Real-time MIDI recording** with quantization (later, with playback).

Annotations: dynamics (text + hairpins), tempo (text + metronome mark),
articulations, fingering (1–5 with hand awareness), pedal (Ped./* and line
style), slurs/phrasing, ottava, expressive text, rehearsal marks, repeats.

## 6. Playback (optional, later)

- Tempo map from tempo marks; dynamics → velocity; pedal → CC64; ties merge;
  repeats/endings expanded to a linear playback sequence.
- Output: Web MIDI to an external synth/DAW, **or** Web Audio with a piano
  soundfont (e.g. via a small sampler library) so it works standalone.
- Look-ahead scheduler (Web Audio clock), moving playhead, click on a note to
  start there. Playback sequence is derived from the model, never stored.

## 7. Milestones

| # | Milestone | Definition of done |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Skeleton + model + single staff | Repo, CI, JSON schema v1, load/save, render one staff of notes/rests with correct spacing and stems. Golden SVG tests. |
| M1 | Grand staff editor MVP | Two staves, multiple measures, key/time sigs, accidentals, beams, chords, ties, dots, line breaking. Keyboard step entry, cursor, undo/redo. |
| M2 | Expressive notation + print | Voices, tuplets, slurs, dynamics, hairpins, articulations, pedal, fingering, tempo, text. Pagination and print-to-PDF at real size. |
| M3 | Interchange + MIDI input | MusicXML import/export with corpus tests; MIDI keyboard step entry. |
| M4 | Playback | Tempo map, Web Audio piano, playhead, MIDI export. |
| M5 | Piano polish | Cross-staff beaming, ottava, grace notes, tremolo, repeats/endings, arpeggio, trills, layout nudging, Tauri packaging. |

M0 and M1 produce something you can actually use to write a short piece.

## 8. Agent plan: tiers and thinking depth

The tiering rule: **the harder it is to know when you're wrong, the higher
the tier.** Engraving algorithms fail silently (output looks "off"); UI
plumbing fails loudly (test fails, button doesn't work).

### Tier 0 — Architect / integrator (Fable, highest reasoning; this session)
- Owns: architecture, the score model schema, the TypeScript interface
  contracts between modules (`Score`, `Command`, `LayoutResult`, `Renderer`,
  `Importer/Exporter`, `PlaybackSequence`).
- Writes the contracts and a handful of reference tests *before* fanning out
  work, so lower tiers build against fixed interfaces.
- Reviews everything from Tier 1; spot-reviews Tier 2; merges worktrees;
  resolves cross-module conflicts.
- Personally verifies any subagent claim about notation correctness.

### Tier 1 — Domain specialists (Opus, high reasoning effort)
Tasks where music-engraving knowledge and algorithmic judgment matter:
- Horizontal spacing and column alignment.
- Beaming, stem direction, multi-voice rest placement.
- Accidental logic and stacking.
- Line breaking and justification.
- Slur/hairpin/pedal placement with skyline collision avoidance.
- Cross-staff beaming.
- MusicXML semantic mapping (what maps to what, and what's lossy).
- Playback tempo/dynamics/pedal interpretation.
Each task gets: the contract, a reference (Gould's *Behind Bars* rules
summarized in the prompt), and a golden-test expectation. One agent per
task, isolated worktree, must deliver tests.

### Tier 2 — Feature implementers (Sonnet, medium reasoning)
Well-specified, testable work:
- Command implementations (insert note, delete, change duration, transpose,
  add articulation…) and undo/redo.
- Keyboard step-entry state machine and key bindings.
- Web MIDI input adapter.
- Selection and hit-testing over the rendered SVG.
- Palettes, inspector panel, file open/save, settings UI.
- Pagination and print CSS; PDF export wiring.
- MusicXML parser/serializer plumbing (given Tier 1's mapping spec).
- Web Audio scheduler and soundfont loading.
Can run several in parallel in separate worktrees because they touch
different directories.

### Tier 3 — Mechanical tasks (Haiku, low reasoning)
- Generate glyph/metrics tables from SMuFL metadata JSON.
- Test fixtures: sample scores in JSON and MusicXML.
- Boilerplate: component scaffolds, config, lint/format fixes.
- Docs: keyboard shortcut reference, README.
- Bulk renames and dependency bumps.

### Supporting roles
- **Explore agents** (read-only) for "where is X handled" questions once the
  codebase is large.
- **Reviewers**: Opus for anything under `engraving/` or `model/`; Sonnet
  `/code-review` for the rest. Reviews check tests exist and pass, not just
  that code reads well.

### Workflow per milestone
1. Tier 0 writes/updates contracts + milestone task list with acceptance tests.
2. Fan out: Tier 1 tasks first (they gate the rest), Tier 2 in parallel where
   contracts allow, Tier 3 whenever.
3. Each agent works in its own git worktree on a branch, runs the full test
   suite, and reports with: what changed, tests added, known gaps.
4. Tier 0 reviews, runs golden renders, merges, updates this plan.

Rough cost shape: most tokens go to Tier 1 in M0–M2 (engraving is the hard
part), shifting to Tier 2 in M3–M5.

## 9. Proposed repository layout

```
personal_music_notation/
  src/
    model/        score types, ids, durations (rational), schema + migrations
    commands/     Command interface, undo stack, all edit commands

```

## 10. Decisions (confirmed 2026-09-13)

1. Stack: TypeScript + own SVG engraver + SMuFL font. Confirmed.
2. Project name: `personal_music_notation`.
3. Font: Bravura.
4. Frank has a digital piano but will connect it later; MIDI input stays at M3.
5. Browser-only until features are settled; port to a native app afterwards.

UI framework: React (chosen over Solid for agent fluency and ecosystem; the
score canvas is custom SVG either way).

## 11. Progress log

- 2026-09-13: Scaffold + Tier 0 contracts committed. M0 fanned out to four
  agents in worktrees: Opus engraver (`src/engraving`), Sonnet renderer + app
  shell (`src/render`, `src/ui`), Sonnet file format + command history
  (`src/io`, `src/commands`), Haiku fixtures + docs (`test/fixtures`, README).
- 2026-09-13 (later): M0 complete. All four branches merged; 174 tests, lint and
  build green. App (`npm run dev`) engraves the six sample fixtures with a picker and
  prints. Golden SVG snapshots in test/golden. Visual check of all fixtures done by
  the architect: stems, beams (4/4, 3/4, 6/8, partial beams), accidentals with measure
  memory, chords with seconds, rests, ledger lines, brace, final barline, title, page
  layout all correct.

  Carry-overs into M1 (from engraver report + review):
  - Key signature must repeat at every system start (currently only where declared).
  - Mid-measure clef changes ignored; repeat barlines drawn as double.
  - Multi-voice: no voice-aware stems/rests, shared accidental memory.
  - Flag width not reserved in column spacing.
  - `GlyphPrim` may want non-uniform scaleX/scaleY for the brace.
  - `History` lacks label accessors for an undo/redo menu.
  - Agent process: Sonnet renderer agent stalled once with nothing written; a
    nudge to "stop exploring, write files in this order" fixed it. Include that
    ordering in Tier 2 prompts from the start.
- 2026-09-13 (M1 start): contracts added (MeasureLayout.columns, src/input/types.ts
  editor state + KeyHandler, note-entry semantics in ARCHITECTURE.md). Fanned out:
  Opus engraving (key sig per system, ties, tied-note accidentals), Sonnet commands +
  pure step-entry key handler, Sonnet editor UI (store, cursor, selection, open/save,
  autosave, undo/redo).
- 2026-09-13 (M1 done): 271 tests, lint and build green. Engraving: key signature at
  every system, key-change cancellation naturals, ties (in-measure, across barline,
  across system break) with tie-aware accidental memory. Editing: span-replace
  writeEvent with rest decomposition, erase, chord add/remove, accidentals, semitone/
  octave transpose, append measure (final barline follows). Pure keyboard step entry
  (MuseScore-style: N, 1-7 durations, ".", A-G nearest octave with key-signature
  alteration, Shift+letter chord, 0 rest, +/- pending accidental, arrows transpose,
  T tie, Backspace/Delete, Tab staff, Home/End, mod+arrows measures, mod+Z/shift+Z).
  UI: store with grouped undo per keystroke, cursor overlay from layout columns,
  click selection and empty-space hit-testing, New/Open/Save .pscore, autosave to
  localStorage, status bar. Verified by the architect in headless Chromium by typing a
  five-measure phrase (quarters, beamed eighths, chord, rest, flat, tied whole notes),
  then undo/redo and autosave.

  Carry-overs into M2:
  - Courtesy key signature at the end of the previous system (needs breaker awareness).
  - Tie tuning: long ties slightly deep (1.2 sp cap); continuation stub tight after clef.
  - No collision avoidance tie vs accidentals/articulations; multi-system ties draw only ends.
  - Entering a rest into an all-rest measure collapses to a measureRest with a new id, so
    the returned selection id is stale (harmless).
  - Duration indicator next to the cursor during entry not shown.
  - Mid-measure clef changes, repeat barlines, voices, tuplets, grace notes still absent.
  - Bass-staff entry works via Tab but nothing enforces piano range; no MIDI yet (M3).
- 2026-09-13 (M1 follow-up from Frank's feedback): Noteflight duration keys (1 whole,
  2 half, 4 quarter, 8 eighth, 6 sixteenth, 3 thirty-second); selection shown as an
  outline around noteheads/rests instead of a blue fill; cursor thin, faint, left of
  the note, and only in note-entry mode; shift/⌘-click and rubber-band multi-select;
  shift+arrows extend selection; ⌘A; ⌘C/⌘X/⌘V with an internal clipboard that pastes
  across barlines by splitting into tied notes; Enter / shift+Enter insert a measure
  after / before; ⌘Backspace removes the measure; Delete erases a multi-selection.
  In-app Shortcuts panel. 306 tests. Verified headlessly by the architect.
- 2026-09-13 (M2 start): Frank's additions: "." and duration keys act on selected notes;
  add/remove staves with clef changes for SATB. Contracts: Part.bracket, StaffDef.name/
  abbreviation, PaletteAction + ActionHandler. Fan-out (parallel): Opus E1 voices +
  tuplets + staff groups/names; Opus E2 attachments + spanners + skyline; Sonnet C1 staff
  commands, duration-on-selection, tuplet entry, notation commands, voices, handleAction,
  keys; Sonnet U1 staves panel, SATB preset, palettes, notehead drag, voice toggle.
- 2026-09-14 (M2 done): 473 tests, lint and build green. Engraving: voices (stems by
  voice, rest offsets, unison offset, invisible rests), tuplets (brackets, numbers,
  nested, beaming by outer tuplet), staff groups (brace/bracket/none) and staff names,
  articulations, fermata, dynamics lane, hairpins, slurs with skyline clearance and
  system-break splitting, pedal text/line, ottava, trill line, glissando, tempo with
  metronome glyph, expression text, fingering. Editing: staff add/remove/clef/name/
  bracket, "." and duration digits on selected notes, tuplet entry (⌘3 etc.) and writing
  inside tuplets, voice switching (V, ⌘⌥1-4) with create-on-demand, hidden rests (H),
  slur (S) / hairpins (< >) keys, palettes for dynamics, articulations, lines, marks,
  fingering, tuplets, durations; Staves panel; New SATB preset; drag a notehead to change
  pitch. Verified by the architect in headless Chromium: dot/duration on selection,
  voice-2 entry (after fixing a cursor clamp that reset the voice), triplet creation and
  fill, palettes, drag D4→F4, SATB + fifth staff with alto clef.

  Carry-overs into M3 (besides MusicXML + MIDI input):
  - ⌘A selects voice 0 only; no keyboard multi-voice selection.
  - Ornaments, arpeggio, tremolo not drawn; 15ma falls back to 8va glyph.
  - Tuplet brackets horizontal; cross-voice rest/note collisions unhandled.
  - Text widths estimated (no font metrics) for labels/tempo/expression.
  - Courtesy key signature at the end of a system before a key change still missing.
  - No "Pasted" status message; first Right-arrow from measure start skips the first note.
  - No lyrics yet (needed for choral work); no part names beyond staff names.
- 2026-09-14 (M3 start): contracts for lyrics (model + engraving/entry rules), MIDI
  handler, MusicXML signatures, fflate for .mxl. Fan-out: Opus MusicXML import/export +
  corpus; Opus lyrics/ornaments/arpeggio/tremolo engraving; Sonnet lyric entry mode,
  MIDI spelling/entry, small fixes; Sonnet MIDI device UI, lyric-mode status, MusicXML
  open/export.
- 2026-09-14 (M3 done, after a rate-limit stop and resume of all four agents): 641 tests,
  lint and build green. MusicXML import/export (partwise, .mxl, voices, tuplets, lyrics,
  directions, repeats/endings, SATB parts → staves); every fixture round-trips; all
  exports and the corpus validate against the W3C MusicXML schema with xmllint.
  Lyrics: model, engraving (verse lanes, hyphens, extenders, spacing, dynamics above
  lyric staves), entry mode (L / ⌘⇧L, Space, "-", "_"). Ornaments, arpeggio, tremolo
  drawn. MIDI: Web MIDI device UI, key-signature spelling, chords from held keys.
  Architect fixes at integration: hyphens repeated every 12 sp (one hyphen per word
  break across a barline); chord tones after a note that filled the measure now join
  it (found in the browser: MIDI G-B-D came out as G alone); Shift+letter builds chords
  upward above the top note; stale status messages cleared on the next key.

  Carry-overs into M4:
  - Exported MusicXML not yet opened in MuseScore/Dorico (schema-valid only).
  - Arpeggio uses a scaled single glyph; wiggle glyphs are excluded by gen-smufl.ts.
  - Pedal line vs lyrics collision possible (lyrics excluded from the skyline).
  - Only voice 0 carries directions on MusicXML export.
  - Earlier carry-overs still open: courtesy key signature at system end, text metrics.
- 2026-09-15: Frank re-scoped M4 from playback to PDF import ("pull PDF sheet music in
  so I can re-arrange it"): staves, key signatures, notes first; other markings if easy.
  Evaluated Audiveris 5.11 on his two samples (a 9-page piano arrangement exported as
  vector outlines, a 2-page InDesign hymnal page in the Maestro font): notes, rhythms,
  keys, meters, pickup, voices correct on checked pages; 414 vs 416 noteheads on the
  hymn; lyrics need Tesseract data (installed). Playback moves to M5.
- 2026-09-15 (M4 done: PDF import). Audiveris 5.11 behind a local service mounted in
  the Vite dev server (server/omr-service.ts; setup: scripts/setup-omr.sh); Import PDF…
  dialog with progress, "Notes only" (default) or "Everything recognized", original
  page/system breaks kept; Compare panel shows the original PDF page following the
  cursor, with a plain-language review list (measures the recognizer left short).
  Engraving: staves spaced by their content (lyric lanes, ledger notes, markings).
  Verified end to end with the real service on both samples: hymn 8.6 s, piano 90.5 s,
  noteheads 414 / 1,588, compare panel follows to the last page. Architect fixes from
  that run: overlapping pdf.js renders garbled the panel; cursor could leave the screen
  (now full-height layout with its own scroll areas); review text was jargon; the M2
  palette row and staves panel printed (extra page). 793 tests.

  Carry-overs:
  - OMR misses 8va lines, some text (tempo, accel.), invents occasional fermatas; the
    compare panel and "Notes only" are the mitigation. Titles may have OCR slips.
  - Review list covers padded voices and validation issues only; it can't know about
    wrong pitches. A side-by-side overlay or measure-level highlight would help.
  - The PDF is kept in memory only (lost on reload); scans untested (only digital PDFs).
  - Playback moved to M5.
- 2026-09-15 (feature: mid-song key changes + manual layout control). Implemented
  directly (no agent fan-out — well-scoped enough for one pass): `setKeySignature`
  command; `LayoutHints.measuresPerSystem`/`systemsPerPage` (upper-bound caps, fit
  always wins) plus `toggleSystemBreak`/`togglePageBreak`/`clearForcedBreaks`
  commands; Key and Layout palette groups. 822 tests (29 new), lint and build clean.
  Verified in the browser on Frank's real sparse-page file: Reflow took it from 15
  pages to 11; a 3-measures-per-line cap on a fresh score rendered exactly 3+3+2.
- 2026-09-15 (feature: selectable markings + a real click-hit-testing fix). Implemented
  directly. Root cause of "only one voice selectable" confirmed live with
  `elementFromPoint`: every glyph's native DOM hit area is its full 4-sp font em-box, not
  its ink, so close simultaneous notes across two voices had overlapping hit regions
  with the later-painted voice always winning. Fixed by replacing ScoreView's DOM
  `closest("[data-id]")` click routing with a pure-geometry `hitTestElement`
  (src/ui/layout-utils.ts), built on generalized per-primitive-type bounding boxes that
  also make slurs/ties/hairpins/pedal/ottava/dynamics/tempo/text/fermata/articulations/
  fingering/tuplets/lyrics/ornaments selectable (not just notes/rests). Added: delete
  routing for spanners/attachments by id (removeSpanner/removeAttachment before falling
  back to note erase), and drag-to-nudge for movable markings via a new
  `layout.nudges` post-processing pass in the engraver (src/engraving/nudges.ts).
  Verified live: the exact two-voice repro now alternates Voice 1/Voice 2 correctly on
  every click; a slur can be clicked, outlined and deleted; a fermata can be dragged
  (confirmed moved on screen and in the persisted nudge) and deleted (nudge cleared).
  867 -> 852 (net) tests incl. a direct regression test reproducing the original bug
  through the real engraving+hit-test pipeline. Found and fixed one real scoping bug
  along the way: fermata shared "articulation"'s role, which is deliberately excluded
  from MOVABLE_ROLES (multiple articulations share one id) — gave fermata its own Ref
  role since it has its own independent Attachment id.

  Carry-overs:
  - Beams have no independent model identity; clicking one selects its first note only.
  - A single articulation/ornament/fingering mark isn't independently deletable from its
    host note (no per-decoration id yet) — deleting the note removes them as a side
    effect. Toggling via the existing palette (toggleArticulation etc.) still works.
  - Large nudges can overlap neighbouring content (applied after extent measurement).
  - Text/line/path hit boxes use estimates (no real font metrics; a safe convex-hull
    bound for bezier paths), same limitation as engraving's own text spacing.
- 2026-09-16 (fix: marking-drag autoscroll jump + Delete erasing the whole note).
  Implemented directly; both reported against Frank's real "Be Still, My Soul" file.
  Root cause 1: ScoreView's cursor-follow scroll effect depended on `layout`, which is
  a fresh object on every edit, so dragging a marking (an edit) re-ran it and jumped
  the view back to the cursor's page. Fixed with a `lastScrolledMeasure` ref that skips
  the scroll unless `cursorMeasure` itself actually changed. Root cause 2: Selection
  carries only ids, no role, so a click resolving to a tie or an articulation (both
  share their host note event's id, having none of their own) left `deleteSelection`
  unable to tell "erase this decoration" from "erase this note" — it always erased the
  note. Confirmed live: several slurs in measures 67-79 visually overlap a tie closely
  enough that a click resolves to the tie. Fixed in `eraseSelected` (step-entry.ts):
  before erasing a note event, it now strips any tied notes and note-level decorations
  (new `clearEventDecorations` in commands/notation.ts) instead, with a status message,
  and only erases the event on a second Delete once nothing is left to strip. 859 tests
  (8 new), lint/typecheck/build clean. Verified live against the real file: dragging a
  slur no longer moves the scroll position at all (pixel-identical before/after); a
  tied chord's tie and a lone accent each survive one Delete with the decoration gone
  and a second Delete erases the note; 400 ArrowRight presses still autoscrolls
  normally (no navigation regression).

  Carry-over: stripping removes all of an event's note-level decorations in one step
  (e.g. an accent and an ornament on the same note both go together), not one at a
  time — same "no per-decoration id" limitation as the carry-over above.
- 2026-09-17: project folder moved from ~/personal_music_notation to
  ~/AI Projects/personal_music_notation (git history, node_modules, gitignored
  sample_sheet_music/ all carried over intact). Verified clean lint/typecheck/859
  tests from the new location; no code referenced the old absolute path.
- 2026-09-18 (feature: editable score info, remembered filename, Save As, app rename).
  Implemented directly. Renamed the app to "Sheet Music Assistant" (was "Personal
  Music Notation") in index.html and the toolbar. Title/subtitle/composer/lyricist
  were set only by import or the New Score form and had no edit path afterward — added
  `setScoreMeta` (src/commands/meta.ts) plus a new toggleable `ScoreInfoPanel` (same
  pattern as StavesPanel: one text input per field, committed on blur). Also found and
  fixed a real gap: lyricist was captured in the model (including via MusicXML import)
  but never engraved anywhere — added it to the title block, top-left, mirroring
  composer's top-right placement. Separately, the app had no notion of "the current
  file" (Open/Save are pure browser downloads, no File System Access API) — added a
  remembered `fileName` (persisted to localStorage like the existing MIDI-input
  memory), a "Save As" button that always prompts for a name, and a filename display
  in the toolbar and the browser tab title. 862 tests (3 new), lint/typecheck/build
  clean. Verified live: editing title/composer/lyricist persists and re-engraves;
  Save with no prior name derives one from the title; Save As prompts and remembers
  the new name; a plain Save afterward reuses it without re-prompting; Open sets the
  remembered name and it survives a page reload; New Score clears it.
- 2026-09-18 (fix: flip stem direction). Frank reported stems flipping to the wrong
  direction when using arrow keys to move notes, citing bar 8 of his real file
  Rob_Mullins_Etudes_Bb.pscore (the A's stem pointing down instead of up). Investigated
  thoroughly: confirmed by direct engraving-output inspection that no pitch-editing
  command (setNotePitch, transposeNotes) has ever touched NoteEvent.stem, and that
  every stem-direction code path in semantic.ts prefers an explicit stem over pitch —
  a dragged note, an octave-transposed note, and one member of a beam group moved 2
  octaves all kept their original direction. The actual cause: bar 8's A already had
  stem: "down" baked into the imported file, almost certainly an Audiveris OMR misread
  of the original engraving, with no existing way to correct it. Added a real fix —
  `toggleStemDirection` (src/commands/notation.ts), wired as a "flipStem" PaletteAction,
  the "X" key (MuseScore's own shortcut for this), and a "Flip Stem" button in the
  Articulations palette group. Converges a whole selection to one direction per press
  so flipping an entire beamed run actually moves its shared direction. 870 tests (8
  new), lint/typecheck/build clean. Verified live against the actual reported note:
  Flip Stem button then "X" correctly toggled both the model field and the rendered
  stem line.
- 2026-09-18 (feature: automatic stem reconciliation on pitch change). Same-day
  follow-up: Frank clarified he wanted the stem to flip on its own whenever a move
  changes which direction is natural, efficiently for a whole moved section, not a
  manual fix per note. Added captureStemBaseline/reconcileStemAfterPitchChange
  (src/commands/notation.ts), called from setNotePitch (mouse drag) and transposeNotes
  (arrow keys): if an event's stem was tracking convention before the move and the
  move changes what convention picks, flips it to match; leaves alone a stem already
  set against convention (deliberate flip, or an uncorrected OMR misread), and never
  touches notes with no explicit stem (they already auto-track via the existing
  no-override render path). Accounts for multi-voice staves (voice convention instead
  of pitch) and mid-score clef changes (exported clefAtMeasureStart from engrave.ts);
  beaming is out of scope, same caveat as the manual flip. transposeNotes batches one
  baseline/reconcile pass per touched event, not per note, so a whole selected section
  moved together is still efficient. 880 tests (12 new), lint/typecheck/build clean.
  Verified live: after one manual toggleStemDirection to re-anchor the already-wrong
  note, moving it down an octave and back up with arrow keys auto-flipped its stem
  both ways with no further manual steps.

  Also, while this was in progress: found the "editable score info" work from earlier
  today had added setScoreMeta (commands/meta.ts) without noticing setMeta already
  existed, unused, in commands/basic.ts. Consolidated onto setMeta (carrying over
  setScoreMeta's clear-on-empty-string behavior) and deleted commands/meta.ts.
- 2026-09-18 (redesign: toolbar). Frank found the New/Open/Save row "ugly and busy"
  and asked for icons, plus moving Shortcuts and Score Info to the far right under
  MIDI. Added six small hand-drawn icons (src/ui/icons.tsx: New/Open/Save/Undo/Redo/
  Print — no icon library in the project's dependencies) grouped into
  `.toolbar-group`s with a `.toolbar-divider` between clusters; Save As, Export
  MusicXML, and the panel/import/compare/sample controls stayed as text. Moved
  Shortcuts/Score Info to the end of the toolbar. Hit and fixed a real bug on the way:
  the icons first rendered blank because their SVGs were being flex-shrunk to ~1px
  wide inside the fixed-width icon buttons; fixed with `flex-shrink: 0` plus explicit
  pixel width/height on `.icon-button svg` (confirmed via computed-style inspection,
  not guessed) — a known gotcha for SVGs in flex containers worth remembering for any
  future icon work here. Verified live via screenshot and a functional pass (Undo
  starts disabled, New opens the form, Save downloads, Print doesn't error, toolbar
  child order matches the requested layout).
- 2026-09-19 (polish: toolbar icons round 2). Frank asked for real curved-arrow
  Undo/Redo icons (the first pass's plain triangles worked but didn't read as
  "undo" clearly), an icon for Save As, treble/bass clef glyphs for Staves, a
  PDF-style icon for Import PDF, tooltips restored on every icon (simple labels:
  "Save", "New", not "Save score"), and every remaining icon-less button pushed to
  the toolbar's far right. Implemented directly: curved-arrow Undo/Redo; a
  SaveAsIcon (a narrower floppy disk plus a separate "+", not overlapping — two
  overlapping disks would need one to mask the other with a fill matching the
  button's current background, which drifts on hover); a PdfIcon (generic
  document + red "PDF" badge, not a copy of Adobe's own mark); a ClefIcon (real
  stacked treble+bass Bravura glyphs, reusing Palettes.tsx's existing
  glyph-as-text-character technique, now exported as `Smufl`); every icon-less
  button now lives in one `.toolbar-text-group` with `margin-left: auto`,
  replacing the previous `.toolbar-doc { margin-right: auto }` (which would have
  split the leftover space between two auto-margins once both existed, pushing
  the icon cluster toward the middle instead of flush left). Verified with a
  zoomed screenshot of the real rendered toolbar, not just the SVG path data —
  this is what actually confirmed the curved arrows read correctly and the clef/
  PDF icons are legible at 16px. 880 tests still passing (no new command logic
  this round, UI-only), lint/typecheck/build clean.
